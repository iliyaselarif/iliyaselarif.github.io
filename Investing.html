    <div class = "ul-container">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diversifying your portfolio:</strong> It is extremely importing when investing in general to diversify your portfolio. The ever-changing
                economy makes many sectors rise or fall together, so you never want to have all of your eggs in one basket because of the chance that whatever your
                investments are in are all related and move together.</li>
            <li><strong>Riding a winner:</strong> One fundamental stock market tactic is "riding" a stock, which essentially means finding
                a stock that is rapidly increasing in price and hopping on the wave. Many investors do not know the point at which the stock
                has hit a relative ceiling so they continue to ride the winner strictly based on momentum and no fundamentals. As a new investor
                this is a great way to get your feet wet and to get a sense as to how a stock's price moves throughout the day. Many times
                you are able to cash in a generous profit simply by just riding a trend like this, without knowing anything about the
                company itself. Using this strategy, it is important that you do not get greedy, as mentioned before, no one knows the tipping
                point of the stock, so if you are one that is riding a stock strictly based on this "riding a winner" philosophy, cash out while
                you can.</li>
            <li><strong>Selling a Loser:</strong> There is no guarantee that a stock will rebound after a protracted decline, and it’s important to
                be realistic about the prospect of poorly-performing investments. And even though acknowledging losing stocks can psychologically
                signal failure, there is no shame recognizing mistakes and selling off investments to stem further loss. This concept is extremely important
                as related to the previous tip of riding a winner, many ride losers and will continue to sell stocks that are declining in value. If
                you are not quick to get out of a losing position, you could end up losing more and more money.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't Overemphasize the P/E Ratio:</strong> Investors often place great importance on price-earnings ratios, but placing too much emphasis on a single metric
                is ill-advised. P/E ratios are best used in conjunction with other analytical processes. Therefore a low P/E ratio doesn't necessarily
                mean a security is undervalued, nor does a high P/E ratio necessarily mean a company is overvalued.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on the Future:</strong> Investing requires making informed decisions based on things that have yet to happen. Past data can indicate things to
                come, but it’s never guaranteed. It’s important to invest based on future potential versus past performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Open-Minded:</strong> Many great companies are household names, but many good investments lack brand awareness.
                Furthermore, thousands of smaller companies have the potential to become the blue-chip names of tomorrow. In fact, small-caps
                stocks have historically shown greater returns than their large-cap counterparts. From 1926 to 2001, small-cap stocks in the U.S.
                returned an average of 12.27% while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) returned 10.53%.
                This is not to suggest that you should devote your entire portfolio to small-cap stocks. But there are many great companies beyond
                those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).
            <li><strong>Hire a Pro:</strong> Finding a professional financial adviser that fits your needs. Some feel that they are better off to pay a
                professional to manage and invest their money rather then spending the time doing the research themselves. Some may have a job that it is more valuable
                to work more hours then to spend those extra hours that they could be working but rather doing research on what to invest in.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Having a plan:</strong> Many real estate investors go into the field without a concrete plan, which often is the reason
                many investors do not see success. Knowing whether you prefer steady income, holding and letting your investment grow, or just quick flipping
                is the first step in becoming successful in the real estate field. An investor that would rather have steady income will most likely choose
                to invest in something like an apartment building where he can depend on steady income every month from investors whereas someone who doesnt
                mind having some of their money tied up may choose to buy a residential home and hold onto it with the intent of selling it in the future
                when the property gains value. Having a plan and knowing what your goals are is the first step in the real estate investing process.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing the market:</strong> Effective real estate investors acquire an in-depth knowledge of their selected market(s).
                Keeping tabs on current trends, including any changes in consumer spending habits, mortgage rates, and the unemployment rate,
                and others, lets real estate investors acknowledge current conditions and plan for the future. This enables them to predict when
                trends may change, creating potential opportunities for the prepared investor.</li>
            <li><strong>Having a plan:</strong> Many real estate investors go into the field without a concrete plan, which often is the reason

                when the property gains value. Having a plan and knowing what your goals are is the first step in the real estate investing process.</li>
            <li><strong>Mastering a field:</strong> While diversifying a portfolio is also extremely important when investing in real estate, it is also just as
                important to master a specific field - residential real estate flipping. Mastering one field allows you to become more profitable
                and enter different niches. A common mistake is to try and invest in all types of real estate before developing a deep
                understanding of one specific field. Once you develop an understanding of one field and have success in investing in that field, it allows
                you to gain more confidence when investing in something new and it allows you to start knowing why you should be diversifying your
                real estate investments because the field you have an understanding of may not be the right investment at the time.

        <p>Tips for Cash and Bond Market Investing</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "ul-container">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Define your objectives: </strong>Is your investment objective to have enough money for your child's college education? Is your
                goal to live comfortably in retirement? If so, how comfortably? You probably have multiple goals. Lay them all out and be as precise as
                you can. Remember: If you don't know where you're going, you'll never arrive.</li>
            <li><strong>Assess your risk profile: </strong>Different bonds and bond funds, like stocks and stock funds, carry different risk profiles.
                Always know the risks before you invest. It's a good idea to write them down so they are all in plain sight.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't try to time the market: </strong>Avoid speculating on interest rates. Decisions are too often made on where rates have been rather
                than where they are going. Instead, stick to the investment strategy that will best help you achieve your goals and objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Know what bonds match your goals: </strong>Knowing what bonds offer what is the first step to investing in the bond market.
                Some bonds pay higher coupons so they would be better for someone looking for steady yearly income, whereas some bonds don't pay any coupon
                but accumulate price growth and are better for someone saving money for retirement.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan to reinvest your coupons: </strong>This allows the power of compounding to work on your behalf. It's a good idea to establish
                a "coupon account" before you start receiving coupons, so that you have a place to save the money and are not tempted to spend it. If you are
                buying a bond fund, you don't have to worry about this—the fund does this for you. Don't try to time the market. Avoid speculating on interest
                rates. Decisions are too often made on where rates have been rather than where they are going. Instead, stick to the investment strategy that
                will best help you achieve your goals and objectives.</li>
