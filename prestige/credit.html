                        If you’re just starting out and building your credit from scratch, consider applying for a student credit card or a secured credit card designed for people with little or no credit.
                        <li>Secured credit cards require a cash deposit that serves as collateral if you miss a payment. If you can, find a card that doesn’t charge an annual fee. And make sure the credit card company reports to all three major credit bureaus, which can help you build or rebuild credit with responsible use.ss</li>
                        <li>Student credit cards give students and young cardholders the chance to build credit — and they may even come with promotional offers and rewards. One potential drawback is that they typically have lower credit limits and higher interest rates.</li>
                        <li>Store credit cards not only help consumers save money at their favorite stores, but they may also give those with little or no credit a chance to prove they can handle money responsibly. Beware of the high interest rates these cards may charge if you carry a balance.</p></li>

                        Your parents might be willing to lend you a hand by making you an authorized user on one of their credit cards, or co-signing a loan with you. Of course, a close friend or another family member may also be able to help.
                        <li>If your parents make you an authorized user on their rewards credit card, you may both benefit. You’ll have a chance to build your credit, while mom and dad may rack up points or cash back on every dollar you spend.
                            But be careful: Some credit cards charge an annual fee for authorized users.
                            The downside (for your parents, at least) is that they’ll be responsible for repaying the money you spend if you don’t. And if that causes them to miss a payment or rack up a lot of debt, it could hurt both of your credit scores.</li>
                        <li>Whether you’re applying for a credit card, student loan or buying your first car, your parents might consider co-signing, which may increase your chance of qualifying if they have good credit.
                            Unlike the case with an authorized user, you’ll both be on the hook for repaying the loan.
                            Keep in mind, if you’re under 21, according to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009, you either have an adult co-signer or show that you make enough money on your own to repay any money you spend on your credit cards.</li>

                        <li>College graduates who make on-time student loan payments may boost their credit. But keep in mind, late payments may have an adverse effect on your scores. Consider setting up automatic payments, so you don’t forget.
                            One more thing to watch out for: Taking out student loans may place more pressure on your overall finances. The more you owe on a student loan, the less money you’ll have on hand to repay other lenders.</li>
                        <li>Buying a car is another way to build credit, if you make on-time payments on your auto loan. Keep in mind, if you pay cash, you may save money on interest, but it won’t help your credit.
                            This is one way even high school students may be able to jumpstart this credit history. Of course, it doesn’t make sense to buy a car solely for the sake of building your credit, so make sure it’s a necessary purchase before asking the dealer to hand over those keys.</li>

                        Now for the good news: If you’re just beginning your credit journey, you may have more credit-building options than you think.
                        Getting approved for a credit card is only the first step. Here are a few recommendations to keep in mind as you begin your credit journey:
                        <li>
                            Don’t pay interest. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to carry a balance to build credit. So consider paying off your entire balance each month to avoid interest charges.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t miss a payment. Late payments can stay on your credit reports for years and wreck your credit. So do your best to make each payment on time, even if you can only afford the minimum payment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t spend too much. While you might be excited about breaking in your new credit card, try not to use more than 30 percent of your available credit. That means if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try not to spend more than $300. Keeping your credit utilization rate low can help improve your overall credit health.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
